These are limitations we will be continuing to explore solutions for. \nPLEASE NOTE : To use Teensy 3.2 with Tee-Naps, you will need to cut the VIN -&gt; VUSB connection on the PCB (as described in the Teensy documentation) for use with an external charger.\n","id":"https://blino.io/blog/batteries/","title":"Batteries vs USB Power"},"https://blino.io/blog/bci-for-makers/":{"body":"It's not a secret any more that we have a couple of interesting shields that will be available very soon.

Further, the jack connector in TR or TRS (Tip Ring / Tip Ring Sleeve) formats, allow us to integrate shielding and multiple lines into single, pluggable electrodes. \nWe have been testing  and working in collaboration with our manufacturers to design these 2.5mm jack electrodes for a little while and we are just getting our first stock in now.\nThese are approximately 30cm in length, allow for easy attachment and feature integrated shielding. These are intended largely for on head applications and we are considering different length variations in future (based on demand).

Cut along the indicated arrow, ensuring that the trace is is cleanly separated. This may require a light sidewards/ twisting pressure or motion. Take appropriate care when working with sharp blades and electronics.\nThis is common practice when working with the Teensy and is documented on the pin diagrams that come with Teensy 3.2. There are two solder pads on the bottom of the Teensy that are joined by a narrow trace. This needs to be cut, separating the VIN and VUSB.
